REQUIREMENTS:

* Linux OS in the best case
* Oracle JDK 6 (not the JRE!)
* Android SDK (API Level 8)
* Android NDK
* Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (if working with the sandbox)

DEPENDENCIES:

* Kiss FFT C/C++ library -- already embedded in the source code
* GreenDroid library fork with custom GDPreferenceActivity -- git submodule, already embedded in the source code but needs to be referenced in the IDE project

HOW TO BUILD:

The Voicesmith repository already contains the Eclipse project file, an auto-generated Ant build script and a custom Makefile to compile APK related files from the command line.

Feel free to setup an IDE of your choise, e.g. Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. But don't forget to download (or check out) all dependencies and reference them in your project.
